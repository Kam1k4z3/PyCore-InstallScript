# PyCore-InstallScript
Dolphin Emulator PyCore Installation Script for Linux platforms
## Usage
Give the permission to the script by doing ```chmod +x ./install.sh``` then execute the script WITHOUT superuser permissions, but ensure that you have the ```sudo``` package installed. Start the script with ```./install.sh```
You will find PyCore's binareis in ./dolphin-emu/Build/Binaries, and the Dolphin's user folder in ./dolphin-emu/Build/Binaries/user
Scripts will be placed at ./dolphin-emu/Build/Binaries/user/Load/scripts
